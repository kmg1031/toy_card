# Toy Card Game

A simple browser-based card game. A Node.js server hosts the game as a single page application.

## Usage

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The game logic is split into modules under `src/` based on `AGENTS.md` guidance.
